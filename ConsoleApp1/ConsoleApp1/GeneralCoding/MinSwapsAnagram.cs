     Find the string from an array that can be converted to a string S with minimum number of swaps
Last Updated : 16 Mar, 2021
Given a string S and an array of strings arr[] of length N and M respectively, the task is to find the string from the given array to the string S by swapping minimum number of characters . If no string can be converted to S, print -1.

Examples:

Input: S = “abc”, arr[] = {“acb”, “xyz”}
Output: acb
Explanation: 
The string “acb” can be converted to “abc” by swapping 1 pair of characters “acb”  -> “abc“.
The string”xyz” cannot be converted to “abc”.
 

Input: S = “abc”, arr[] = {“ab”, “xy”, “cb”}
Output: -1

Approach: The problem can be solved by searching for anagrams of S from the given array of strings and then, for every such string, find the minimum number of character swaps required to convert the string to S.




Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

Traverse the array of strings and for each string present in the array, check if it is an anagram of S or not. 
If no such string is found, then print -1.
Otherwise, find the minimum number of swaps required to convert the current string into S, by iterating over the characters of the current string, say S1.
Store the position of characters in S1 in 26 lists. For each character in S1, append its index to its corresponding list, i.e., list 0 stores all positions of the character ‘a’. Similarly, list 1 stores all positions of ‘b’ and so on.
After complete traversal of the string S1, iterate over the characters of the string S in reverse and for each character, say S[j], get its respective index from the given array of lists, say temp.
Now, the optimal move is to move the character at the last index in temp to the index j. This is optimal because:
Characters are being moved in every move. Hence, no move is being wasted.
The last index in temp would be closer to j than other indices as the string is being iterated in reverse.
To optimize, a Fenwick tree can be used to determine the modified positions of characters in S1, in case of any swaps.
 Illustration:

Suppose, S = “abca”, S1 = “cbaa”
Below is the list generated for S1:
List for ‘a’ = {2, 3}
List for ‘b’ = {1}
List for ‘c’ = {0}
Iterate over the characters of S, in reverse, by initializing minMoves with 0.

S = “abca”, i = 3
Remove last index from list corresponding to ‘a’, i.e. 3.
Search the Fenwick Tree to check if there are any indices to the left of this index in the Fenwick Tree or not. 
Since the tree is empty now, no need to shift this index.
Add index 3 to the Fenwick Tree. 
minMoves += (i – index) = (3 – 3). Therefore, minMoves = 0
S = “abca”, i = 2
Remove the last index from list corresponding to ‘c’, i.e. 0.
Search the Fenwick Tree to check if there are any indices to the left of this index in the Fenwick Tree or not.  
Since the only index in the tree is 3, and it is to the right of 0, no need to shift this index.
Add index 0 to the Fenwick Tree. 
minMoves += (i – index) = (2 – 0). Therefore, minMoves = 2
S = “abca”, i = 1
Remove last index from list corresponding to ‘b’, i.e. 1.
Search the Fenwick Tree to check if there are any indices to the left of this index in the Fenwick Tree or not.  
The count obtained is 1, i.e. there was one character to the left of index 1, which is now, towards it’s right.
Add index 1 to the Fenwick Tree.
new index = 1 – leftShit = 1 – 1 = 0
minMoves += (i – new index) = 1 – 0 = 3
S = “abca”, i= 0 
Remove last index from list corresponding to ‘a’, i.e. 2.
Search the Fenwick Tree to check if there are any indices to the left of this index in the Fenwick tree or not.  
The count obtained is 2, i.e. there were two characters to the left of index 2, which is now, towards its right.
Add index 2 to the Fenwick Tree.
new index = 2 – leftShit = 2 – 2 = 0
minMoves+= (i-new index) = 0 – 0 = 3   
Below is the implementation of the above approach:
