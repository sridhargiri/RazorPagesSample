The following are the 3 popular patterns used for caching in microservices architecture

Cache-Aside
Read-Through/Write-Through
Write-Behind

self study Part 1
-----------------
attribute routing (outgoing url), 
multiple action filter order [ https://www.strathweb.com/2012/06/control-the-execution-order-of-your-filters-in-asp-net-web-api/ ], 
filter that has dependency TypeFilter
angular mergemap (parallel requests) / concatmap (one after other) / catchError (function substitution if error)
.net core jwt serialize
web api when no cache
azure load balancer
http trigger function json
aspnet core docker image
docker dependencies file
azure api management url rewrite for backend api
vm deploy vs azure app service
.net core tls mutual authentication passed in cookies
compressing requests
azure hosting and deployment web apps vs vm
mount vs render
js higher order functions (function as argument or return value): js book https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html
js partial function (can take multiple args)
.net 6 features (minimal api, Top level, MapMethods for Patch, Results.Ok, services, PublishSingleFile, PublishTrimmed)

dependency register cs microservice
call api in another api microservices
parts of http request = header and body (uri is comprised of method, scheme, server, path, query)
azure function deploy,authlevel
connect function to onprem database hybrid connection
ef core db first oracle
azure cdn, azure blob auto delete old archive via webjob or timer trigger or lifecycle management,lease blob
azure functions heavy data load
.net event driven = https://github.com/event-driven-dotnet/home
ZeroMQ (NetMQ.Sockets)
temp table vs table variable (both reside in tempdb, but table variables do not perform logging, transaction)

self study Part 3
-----------------
abstract vs interface,static class vs singleton
angular change detection, share-data-between-sibling-components-in-angular, ngrx state, web components
async pipe - pure/impure pipes

axios/fetch (both are promise based)
***********************************
third party so backward (or) legacy allowed/inbuilt so only latest browser support
direct post data/post body as stringified
receive automatic json/receive json()
cancellable and interceptable/the opposite
outside 200-299 rejected/unsuccess response resolved

react => debouncing,httpevent,usecallback (it also has dependency array like useEffect),useRef, hooks, virtual DOM vs shadow DOM
react => props.children (special prop to pass data from the parent component to child but this data must be enclosed within the parent’s opening and closing tag (mostly used in wrapper components))
react => diffing (only changed portion of V-DOM is sent to UI), batch update, reconciliation, key (uniquely identify each element and keep track of changed elements in list)
react => three ways to avoid props drilling: redux, usecontext, container composition
react => fragment (list of children without adding extra nodes) vs portal (render children into DOM outside hierarchy) vs outlet
Note on useEffect => Nothing specified = This runs after every render / specified empty array = This runs only on mount (when the component appears / pass value to trigger change of a particular value)

bybox:ABC A<B<C where A=1,C=10 combinations 120
sql server optimistic and pessimistic concurrency models => optimistic (rowversion - code level) & pessimistic locking (db level - 4 types)
lock inside async doesnot work - Use SemaphoreSlim
.net core json order (appsettings, secret, env var, cmd var) => env var override launchsettings
.net core json file types (6 = launchsettings, appsettings, bundleconfig, project, bower, global)
